# PolymerMFR
This project is a study of the Polymer Melt Flow Rate (MFR) and the correlation with other labels, and the main research purpose is to find the best ML algorithm to predict MFR based on the dataset in this link: http://apmonitor.com/pds/index.php/Main/PolymerMeltFlowRate
# Background: 
There are gas phase and liquid slurry reactors that create polymers (polyethylene,
polypropylene, polystyrene, and others) from chemical building blocks known as monomers
(C2=, C3=, C4=, iC5=, and others). A catalyst is injected with the monomers under carefully
controlled temperature and pressure conditions to cause a reaction that grows the polymer
chains. Hydrogen is a chain transfer agent to stop the growth of the polymer chain. If the
polymer chains grow too long then the polymer is too viscous for manufacturing in films,
injection molding, or other applications.
